### Brainstorming:
- How are devices different from "regular" nodes (e.g. neurons)
    - One copy per virtual process (always?)
    - Local delivery right after emitting event
    - Difference between sending and receiving devices (are there any other special types?)

- How are weight recorders implemented in NEST, as those connect to synapses directly
